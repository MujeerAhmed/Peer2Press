# Peer2Press

Peer2Press is a peer-to-peer news application that emerged as a result of a hackathon conducted by LeagueX Gaming. On P2P, users can actively share and engage with local news happening around them. On this platform, users can share images of local events, and the application will fact-check and verify the authenticity of the news broadcasted.
